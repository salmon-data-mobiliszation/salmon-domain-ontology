"""Enforce CONVENTIONS section 5b mapping placement and coherence rules.

Five checks, all CI-fatal:

1. Foreign-subject statements outside alignment modules: a subject smn does
   not own may carry only documentation annotations (comment/seeAlso/
   isDefinedBy) and bare declaration stubs. Everything else — Tier-1 axioms
   AND instance-level property assertions — is confined to the alignment
   modules; the annotated NCBITaxon MIREOT mirror in module 02 is the one
   explicit exception.
2. One strongest mapping per subject-object pair, checked two ways: within
   every single module/view file (covers 08/09, alignment-research, views —
   the promotion-staging exception is cross-module by definition and can
   never apply within one file), and across the default build spine (which
   excludes alignment-research, the documented staging exception).
3. Reasoner-clean typing invariant: no IRI in the flattened build may be
   typed both owl:Class and skos:Concept (the dual-representation rule).
4. No lexical labels on foreign-namespace subjects, anywhere in smn's
   sources — alignment modules included. Upstream owns its own labels
   (CONVENTIONS 5b rule 3, "import upstream alignments; do not restate
   them"); smn may declare a foreign term and annotate it with prose, but
   restating its name is how a mirror drifts out of agreement with the
   thing it mirrors.
5. Label unambiguity across each build closure: at most one rdfs:label and
   one skos:prefLabel per subject per language tag, and no rdfs:label that
   disagrees with its subject's skos:prefLabel by case or whitespace alone.

Checks 4 and 5 were added 2026-08-16. A label-consuming renderer given two
equally-valid English labels for one subject picks one arbitrarily, so its
output changes between runs with no semantic change behind it — that is what
OWL2VOWL did to dfo-salmon-ontology's docs pipeline, which had to pin to
skos:prefLabel to work around it (its ADR-007). Check 4 stops smn creating
that ambiguity in someone else's terms; check 5 stops it appearing in smn's
own merged artifacts from any direction.

Retirement condition for checks 4 and 5: retire them when label uniqueness is
enforced for the whole ecosystem by a shared upstream gate — a SHACL shape or
ROBOT report run identically by smn, gcdfo, and the PSC vocabularies — so that
this repo-local restatement is redundant rather than load-bearing. Until then
they stay: this repo publishes terms other repos re-serialize, and it is the
only place the invariant is checked at the source.
